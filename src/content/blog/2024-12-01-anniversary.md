It was a cold day of December in 2004 when a group of computer science students at Politecnico di Milano came together to play iCTF, a Capture The Flag competition organized by UC Santa Barbara. They had no idea what they were doing, but they were excited to learn and to have fun. They called themselves
"Tower of Hanoi". And so, the journey began.

Over the years, many generations of students have come and gone, but the spirit of the team has remained the same. The team has grown in size and in skill, and has become a well-known name in the world of cybersecurity competitions, especially when teaming up with other big teams under mhackeroni for the most prestigious events.

This December, we are celebrating 20 years of Tower of Hanoi. We have come a long way since that cold day in 2004, and we are proud of what we have achieved. We have won many competitions, made many friends, and learned a lot along the way. We are excited to see what the future holds for us, and we are looking forward to many more years of hacking.
