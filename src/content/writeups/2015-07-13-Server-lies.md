> What do we have here? It seems a normal session between a user and some google servers, but actually one of them is lazy and it's lying on a couch. What a bad luck! Will you be able to exploit this unforgivable behaviour?





The title is a hint: the server tells the client that the communication is encrypted with a certain ciphersuite, while actually the message number 13 has been tampered.

Since message 13 has been tampered with: in the field "encrypted data", the original

```
00000000000000011C27634713D81517AB02A5F51F28E8868BA
89F9764E9FB4078B25689011EE6FC41DD5D5321F99A45A73139
```
has been replaced with

```
93a3c4b2c570e768f4044e0a4c5aeab7b1e2e26ac8371117
```

Padded with as many 00 as needed to match the original length.

Discarding the final 00 and converting `93a3c4b2c570e768f4044e0a4c5aeab7b1e2e26ac8371117` to an integer value we get
`n = 3620115404019777021855203292005859579843541360704566530327i` which can easily be factorized in
`p = 49727547581930298376698201253`, `q = 72798993315633226794104718859`.


n can be used as a 192 bits rsa modulus in a school textbook rsa implementation.
Message 14 has been altered with the same procedure by injecting the value
`925a684f87209401f4213cf1a6eca21c62d12703d61416bd` which is the ciphertext encrypted
with the public key `<e,n> = <65537, n>`

By factoring n and guessing e (really easy, since 65537 is by far the most common
choice for the encryption exponent),
one is able to compute z = phi(n) and thus the decryption exponent d.
After the decryption the plaintext ```flag{fuuckk-rsa-use-ecc}``` is recovered.

Summing everything up:

```
